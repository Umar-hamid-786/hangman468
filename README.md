# Hangman

## Description of project
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Purpose of project 
The aim of the project is to utillise the skills learnt such as python fundementals, git and usage of the command line to create the Hangman game.

## What I learnt
1) I learnt how to neaten code to which it is readable by others. This was done through splitting of code into classes and thus methods. This de-abstracts code and encapsulates similar logic together. 

2) I became more confident in using python code to develop logic. For example, using set functions within code which I have not done until now.

3) I learnt the importance of OOP in digusing large code into a readbale manner then is then reuseable. 

4) The biggest takeaway from creating Hangman is to ensure the code logic is in the correct position. This includes if statments, for loops and such. I need to be more aware
as this caused time debugging errors due to incorrect identation.


## How to install Hangman

1) Copy the link to the remote git depository located at the code dropdown list.
2) run the following code to recieve all the updated code: 
        git pull origin https://github.com/Umar-hamid-786/hangman468.git

## How to run game
To run Hangman, you need to type 'python milestone_5.py' in the bash command line to run the game. 

## File structure of the project
The file structure of the project is a multiple files of milestones ranging from 2-5, with 5 being the final piece of finished code. 
All files are .py files with exception of the read.me file.
